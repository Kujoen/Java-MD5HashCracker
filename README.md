# MD5Brute
MD5 hash cracking programm. Created to learn about java multithreading and thread optimizations.

Requires Commons-Lang-3-3.7

Can run in password-file-mode (reads passwords from directory src/passwords/) and in permutation mode.
If you set file-mode and permutation mode to true, it will first use the password lists and then start permutating.  

Modification of the settings must be done by changing the actual variables, there is no console interaction.

This programm is purely educational as should not be used for anything.
